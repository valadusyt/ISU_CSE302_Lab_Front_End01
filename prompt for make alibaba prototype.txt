Build a single-file web application prototype based on Alibaba.com, named index_1038.html (1038 = last 4 digits of my ISU ID).

Requirements:

Use only HTML, CSS (inline or <style>), JS (inside <script>), JSON, and Bootstrap (via CDN).

Do not use external JS/CSS files.

Use Bootstrap grid and components for a professional layout.

Use JSON objects/lists (embedded) to dynamically generate product cards and categories.

Include Navbar (with logo text "Alibaba Clone", search bar, category dropdown, login/cart links).

Include Hero Banner (full-width section with call-to-action text/buttons).

Include Product Categories Section (cards or icons for categories like Electronics, Fashion, Machinery, etc.).

Include Product Grid Section (4-column grid on desktop, 2-column on tablet, 1-column on mobile).

Add Filters (category dropdown & price range filter) and Search (filter products by name dynamically).

Include Modal Popup that shows product details when a product card is clicked (render details from JSON).

Include Footer (links like About, Contact, Help, etc.).

Make it fully responsive using Bootstrap breakpoints.

Write modular, readable JavaScript for filtering, searching, and modal handling.

Use responsible, smart AI-generated text and images (like product names, descriptions, prices).

Keep layout clean, professional, and close to Alibabaâ€™s marketplace style but simplified.

Everything must be in one HTML file only.

Deliverables:

Complete index_1038.html file.

README.md file describing technologies used, features, and instructions to run.

(Optional) A browser snapshot (PNG) to show final UI.
